I am a PhD student (since 2018) in School of Sofware at Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Yue Gao](http://gaoyue.org/cn_tsinghua/index). I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree at Tsinghua University. Click [here](https://zzz14.github.io/files/CV-Zizhao.pdf) to view my up-to-date CV.

My current research interests include brain science, graph signal processing and complex network. Lately, I have been proposing novel tensor-based dynamic hypergraph learning framework for childhhood ASD automated diagnosis.
